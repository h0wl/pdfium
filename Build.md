# Building PDFium #

## Prerequisites ##
Get the chromium depot tools via the instructions at http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-depot-tools (this provides the gclient utilty needed below).

Also install Python, Subversion, and Git and make sure they're in your path.

Optionally, you may want to install the [Ninja](http://martine.github.io/ninja/) build system (recommended) rather than using your platform-specific build system.

## Get the code ##
```
mkdir pdfium
cd pdfium
gclient config --name . --unmanaged https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium.git
gclient sync
```

## Generate the build files ##
Now we use the GYP library to generate the build files.

At this point, you have two options. The first is to generate platform-specific build files, i.e. Makefiles on Linux, sln files on Windows, and xcodeproj files on Mac.

On Windows:
```
build\gyp_pdfium
```
For all other platforms:
```
build/gyp_pdfium
```

The second option is to use the [Ninja](http://martine.github.io/ninja/) build system. To do so, set the GYP\_GENERATORS environment variable to 'ninja' before running the above command.


## Building the code ##
If you used Ninja, you can build the sample program by:
```
ninja -C out/Debug pdfium_test
```
You can build the entire product (which includes a few unit tests) by:
```
ninja -C out/Debug
```

If you're not using Ninja, then building is platform-specific.

On Linux:
```
make pdfium_test
```

On Mac, open build/all.xcodeproj

On Windows, open build\all.sln

## Running the sample program ##
The pdfium\_test program supports reading, parsing, and rasterizing the pages of a .pdf file to .ppm output image files (windows supports two other formats, and .png support is available for all platforms in an alternate branch (see branches section below)).  For example:
```
out/Debug/pdfium_test --ppm path/to/myfile.pdf
```

## Branches ##
There is a branch for a forthcoming feature called XFA that you can get by following the steps above, then:
```
git checkout origin/xfa
build/gyp_pdfium
ninja -C out/Debug
```

The XFA version of the sample pdfium\_test program supports rasterizing to .png format files.  For example:
```
out/Debug/pdfium_test --png path/to/myfile.pdf
```
